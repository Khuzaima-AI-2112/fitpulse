# Fitpulse 🏋️‍♀️🚴‍♀️

A simple Python-based fitness activity tracker built in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Welcome to **Fitpulse**! This project is a command-line fitness activity tracker developed in Python and presented as a Jupyter Notebook. It's designed to help you log your various workouts and monitor your progress towards your fitness goals. With Fitpulse, you can easily record different types of activities, see how close you are to hitting your daily and weekly exercise targets, and even get recommendations for your next workout based on your activity history.

## ✨ Features

* 🏃‍♀️ **Activity Logging**
    Effortlessly add new fitness activities, including the type of exercise, duration, and calories burned.

* 🎯 **Goal Tracking**
    Visualize your progress towards predefined daily and weekly goals for both exercise duration and calories burned using clear indicators (✅/⏳).

* 📊 **Activity Summary**
    Get a quick overview of all the unique types of fitness activities you engage in.

* 💡 **Personalized Recommendations**
    Receive suggestions for activities you might enjoy, based on your past workout data or preferred types.

* 🖥️ **Interactive Menu**
    Navigate the tracker's features through a simple and intuitive command-line menu interface within the notebook.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

This project is a practical way to learn and apply fundamental Python programming concepts:

* `Lists`: Used to maintain a collection of all logged fitness activities.
* `Sets`: Tracks and stores the unique types of activities performed without duplicates.
* `Dictionaries`: Structures the data for each individual activity (type, duration, calories) and defines fitness goals.
* `Functions`: Organizes the code into reusable blocks for different functionalities like adding activities, calculating totals, and checking goals.
* `Loops`: Iterates through the list of activities for calculations and analysis.
* `Conditionals`: Implements logic for checking goal completion and handling user input.
* `Input/Output`: Manages user interaction for logging activities and displaying results.
* `Jupyter Notebook`: Presents the code and explanations in an interactive notebook format.

## 💻 Installation

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the **Jupyter Notebook** environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.

2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3.  **Install Jupyter Notebook (if you don't have it):**

    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5.  **Open the notebook:** In the Jupyter Notebook interface that opens in your web browser, navigate to and click on the `Fitpulse.ipynb` file to open it.

## ▶️ How to Use

1.  **Run the cells:** Execute the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially from top to bottom.
2.  **Interact with the menu:** The last code cell will run the main application loop. You will see a menu printed in the output of that cell.
3.  **Enter your choice:** Type the number corresponding to the action you want to perform (e.g., `1` to Log New Activity, `2` to View Progress) and press Enter.
4.  **Follow the prompts:** The program will guide you through entering details for new activities or display your progress and recommendations based on your choice.
5.  **Exit:** To close the program, enter `4` when the main menu is displayed.

## Future Enhancements
Here's what could be added in future versions of Fitpulse:

💾 Data Saving — Implement functionality to save logged activity data to a file (like CSV or JSON) and load it when the notebook is opened, so your data persists.
📈 Advanced Analytics & Visualization — Introduce more detailed reporting, track trends over time, or visualize your fitness data using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
⚙️ Customizable Goals — Allow users to set and modify their own daily and weekly duration and calorie goals.
🌐 Web Interface — Explore building a web-based interface for Fitpulse using a web framework.
🗓️ Date and Time Tracking — Record the date and time for each activity to enable tracking and analysis over specific periods.
